# TilarGL
TilarGL is a classlib which basically serves as a C# wrapper for OpenGL functions and enums as well as GLFW functions and enums.

## Important note
As you can see there are just bash scripts in the repository. Please forgive me if you are a Windows user, I have not had the chance yet to provide myself with a Windows computer in order to give 
you batch files as alternative.

## Installation
TilarGL does not have a NuGet library available yet. Once I feel like the library has reached a solid state, I will start pushing packages. For now, just refer to the DLL file in your project.

## Building

### Requirements
To build this library you need dotnet core 2.1 or newer. I recommend going with the latest version when possible.

### Sources
Instead of having a solution file with several class libraries added to it, which each contains more or less the same content, I decided to use one 'base' source, which contains all C# class files with
placholders. This repository contains a tool to generate the actual source for you. From there on, you can use the dotnet cli to do whatever you want. The reason why I did it is to prevent having to
maintain multiple library projects for multiple operating systems with code that is for like 95% similar. Now I need to modify only one source and let the generator do everything else for me.

### Step-By-Step
Without further ado, this is how you build the project:

* Run ./init on Linux or ./init.cmd on Windows to build the tools and setup your workspace.
* Run ./generate on Linux or ./generate.cmd on Windows to generate an entire solution from the 'src-base' folder.
* Now cd into the 'src-tilargl' folder and use the dotnet cli the build the solution

## Usage
After succesfully building the library, you will have a DLL file which you can refer to in your projects. However, that is not enough. You will need to make sure you got the right dependencies in place.

### OpenGL
#### Windows
Most Windows system ship a dll called "opengl32.dll". If not, make sure your hardware supports OpenGL and that your drives are up-to-date.

#### Linux
I cannot provide instructions for all distros because I don't know all of them. Nor would that be doable. So I just go along with the most popular one, which in this case is Ubuntu. Run below commands to
install OpenGL on your system, if you have not done so already.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```

### GLFW
#### Windows
In theory you can just download the pre-compiled binaries from https://www.glfw.org/download.html. But for the sake of easyness, I decided to include them in 'lib/windows'.

#### Linux
The developers did not provide a pre-compiled library for Linux because that would not be applicable for all distros. However, I still decided to go ahead and compile it for Ubuntu only,
because it is currently the most popular distro out there. You can find it in the folder 'lib/ubuntu'.

## Contributing
I would highly appreciate it if you would help me polish this library. I have not had the chance yet to test all wrapped methods in the classes since there are over like 30000. I actually generated
them based on an XML provided by the Khronos Group a couple of years ago. So probably there are new functions and enums already which have not been integrated yet. So feel free to send in a pull request!
